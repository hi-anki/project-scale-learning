# Project "Scaling Learning"

The idea is to optimise my learning process and cognitive capabilities to the point that I can reduce the total time taken more than by half.0

I have been improving my mental game since more than 9 months and finally I have got the opportunity to test this idea which I am having in my mind since 2-3 months.

Distraction = Already Zero
Minor Deflection = Deliberately would be made zero

So, I have got 10 days at lest, to test this idea.

For these 10 days, I am deliberately going to cut every deflection left.
  - Social media is already no more in my life.
  - Minor online communication is stopped already.
  - Some media consumption was there, as a part of deflection, and I am going to cut that for 10 days.

The idea I want to test is, "how far and fast I can go if there is no friction?"
  - My assessment of the present says that I am not going to get such alignment anywhere near.
  - And therefore, I am doing this.

Also, I attribute my slow progress to external factors. Though I have already optimised a lot and I have tried to change my mental outlook a lot, but at this point, no change in outlook is helping me out. And therefore, I am want to see if I am just sabotaging myself by masking my incapabilities with external factors, or is it really about external factors at this point.
  - If it is about external factors, I will get a chance to optimise further, so that my 2 months, which I am going to run another experiment are not wasted largely.
  - It if it about inner sabotage, I will still get a chance to improve my mental capabilities to tackle this problem.

This would also help me deciding the next plan after these 2 months.

My current plan is to complete **arrays and strings** in *intel x86_64 ASM* by the evening of 31st May. This task would have taken at least 4-5 days in the scenario I was in so far. But now it should not take more than 1.5-1.7 day, or about ~15 hours. Because now I have complete silence and focus.

Very good morning, and the project is ON.

So, yesterday we have decided upon something, right? Testing out how fast I can go if the surface is really frictionless.

The first task I too complete was learning arrays and strings. From previous experiences, I have estimated a timeline of 20h. Upon reductions, I decided the total time taken should be ~15h. I have also calculated that in this best case, I must be devoting 10h/day. And by this, I reached on the conclusion that I would be completing this by 12 noon, 31st May.

But, it seems that I have completed it. And the total time I took is 3h and 50m. And half the time I only learned about surrounding things like symbols, symbol vs label, scopes etc.... And around last 10-15 minutes, at least, were invested on deciding if this is really true or not.

Now this thing is concerning to me. Because, I took only 26.67% of the total time I thought it would take. And this gives rise to alarming thoughts. And I feeling so damn bored while writing all this, but I know that I feel afraid of seeing the reality one more time.

Here are those thoughts:
  1. Estimation != Reality, never ever!
     - Either I have to do more work than I assumed, or I have to do less work than assumed.
     - When Estimation < Reality, I have to do more work than expected, and total time taken is increased.
     - When Estimation > Reality, I have to do less work than expected, and total time is decreased.
  2. I am never tired when I think "I am tired".
     - Even after this moment, I have enough energy to move forward.
     - And it is not about "I charge my phone whenever I am not using it, not when it is completely discharged," it is about the fact that I shut down and use them that time to waste. I don't sleep.
  3. Instincts matters, but so as their interpretation.
     - If the interpretation of my instincts is right, I will save my resources and will advance faster.
     - If the interpretation is wrong, either I will end up being underconfident or overconfident. And in both the cases, I will get belted by the reality.
  4. External factors, which are the centre theme of this experimentation, the first experiment had proven that external factors do have a sway on me. It's not black and white. It's grey.
     - But as much as external factors are concerned, my own incapabilities are also concerned.
     - It is true that there was no friction today and that's the primary reason why I am able to work with such clarity and speed, but it is equally necessary to point out the reason that I was able to advance so fast today is because I was moving with a madeup mind. The clarity with which I was moving was aided by zero environmental distractions, and as a result, there was no one or nothing which can make me forget what I am up to.
     - The whole reason behind such conclusion of this pursuit is "I didn't forget what I was up to." All the time, I remembered that I have decided to complete arrays and strings in assembly today. I will not get such frictionless position anytime soon. I have to earn it and universe has given me like a credit line of 10 days to test my assumptions and mental models about the idea, that I am only hindered by externalities.
     - The mental playground was just as before. Was there an increase in mental strength? Certainly yes. But is it that significant to cause this big changes? No.
     - The reason is there was no external problem. I manifested in night that I don't want any deflection. I will not go on my side and I request the universe to not let me go there. And it worked perfectly.
     - The reason I am not counting it as a success yet is because I still need some data to verify if this is not a diversion. And I am on it.
     - But it is rewarding to see that external factors do have sway on me, but so as my mental state.
     - And these two are needed in harmony if I want to advance like crazy. All those amazing ideas, which take time and energy, and resources in abundance, as per my thoughts, in reality, they just want a distraction free enviornment. An environment where there is no external factor having sway on me. There is nothing coming as an obstacle which is forcing me to forget who I am and what I identity I am trying to forge and what goal I walked in with.

One thing that is proven to be true in these 5.5 hours since morning is that "I do need silence." This is how I can put in quality work. And I know that in the upcoming 10 days, this thought is only going to become stronger, and I will be having more data to support it.

And I am not someone who can put wireless earphones or over the ear headphones, put some music and then work. No I can't.
  - My learning process is heavily dependent on "me talking to me". And I don't give a damn if people think I am a psycho talking to the self.
  - I just can't do two things, processing music and processing knowledge. I just can't
  - I don't want any kind of sound reaching my ears. I don't want anything, a song, a musical beat, someone talking, someone shouting, bike starting, someone coughing, nothing.
  - I want a surrounding which is silent. Simple. Because I want to hear myself. Because I want to hear knowledge. Because I want to listen assembly speaking to me.
  - And that can't happen until there is pin drop silence.
  - I just want to forget even my own existence when I am in my studies. I extremely love studying like that. No strings from past, no string from future, just me sitting with knowledge, letting knowledge guide me.
  - I need peace of mind before I can start a session. And when I have it, my mind transcends into a state where my instincts are more sound and correct.
  - I don't if I am right or not, but my instincts, the gut feeling told me I need to stop here. There is no need to write whole assembly for traversing arrays, or taking and input and forming an in array, or writing strlen or strcmp from scratch. My instincts told me I am having enough knowledge and now I can learn as required.

I get tired when I have to fight to get into the environment that I need to study.
  - Today, there was no fight at all. And that's the reason why I am still feeling cognitively sharp.
  - There is no dizziness in my eyes. 
  - My back is not hurting.
  - I won't say I am in a flow state, but I am in state where I can learn well, without any problems. And I just want that.
  - My body is tired not because of studying, but because of fighting just so that I can study.
  - And when today it doesn't have to fight, it feels so happy. It wants to just learn so much before the moonlight goes and dark knight arrives. It just want to learn everything it can in the meantime, until the time comes when it has to fight again.

Those pesky voices, that surrounds my brain and don't leave me, they still revolve, but they don't matter to me at this point. You want to revolve, do that. But just let me study. But I can't act like this when my env is not supporting. It is as if I get a chance to blame game, which I don't want to play. I want to advance towards the path of knowledge, light, technology, not deflection, sadness, exhaustion!
