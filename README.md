# Project "Scaling Learning"

The idea is to optimise my learning process and cognitive capabilities to the point that I can reduce the total time taken more than by half.0

I have been improving my mental game since more than 9 months and finally I have got the opportunity to test this idea which I am having in my mind since 2-3 months.

Distraction = Already Zero
Minor Deflection = Deliberately would be made zero

So, I have got 10 days at lest, to test this idea.

For these 10 days, I am deliberately going to cut every deflection left.
  - Social media is already no more in my life.
  - Minor online communication is stopped already.
  - Some media consumption was there, as a part of deflection, and I am going to cut that for 10 days.

The idea I want to test is, "how far and fast I can go if there is no friction?"
  - My assessment of the present says that I am not going to get such alignment anywhere near.
  - And therefore, I am doing this.

Also, I attribute my slow progress to external factors. Though I have already optimised a lot and I have tried to change my mental outlook a lot, but at this point, no change in outlook is helping me out. And therefore, I am want to see if I am just sabotaging myself by masking my incapabilities with external factors, or is it really about external factors at this point.
  - If it is about external factors, I will get a chance to optimise further, so that my 2 months, which I am going to run another experiment are not wasted largely.
  - It if it about inner sabotage, I will still get a chance to improve my mental capabilities to tackle this problem.

This would also help me deciding the next plan after these 2 months.

My current plan is to complete **arrays and strings** in *intel x86_64 ASM* by the evening of 31st May. This task would have taken at least 4-5 days in the scenario I was in so far. But now it should not take more than 1.5-1.7 day, or about ~15 hours. Because now I have complete silence and focus.

Very good morning, and the project is ON.
